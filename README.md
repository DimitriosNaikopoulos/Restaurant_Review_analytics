# Restaurant Review analytics.
This is a text mining project developed by me and my coleagues in University of Manchester. Perpuse of this project
is to provide Natural Language Proccessing methods in a Tripadvisor's dataset in order to answer question like which restaurant type the
European users seems to prefer. The data for this project was acquired throught the kaggle and the pipeline was programmed in R. Also,
Python was used for some data cleaning and data preperation.
