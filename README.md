# Restaurant Review analytics.
This is a text mining project developed by me and my colleagues at the University of Manchester. Purpose of this project is to provide Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in a Tripadvisor's dataset in order to answer questions like which restaurant type the European users seem to prefer. The data for this project was acquired through the kaggle and the pipeline was programmed in R. Also, Python was used for some data cleaning and data preparation.

## The project
Code coming soon!
